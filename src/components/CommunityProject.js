          At the Rice Long Distance Run Club, we believe that fitness is more than just exercise—it’s a tool for building stronger, healthier, and more connected communities.
          <br /><br /><br />
          Through our partnership with Fonde Civic Club, we are bringing free fitness programming to underserved communities in Houston. From running and yoga to mindfulness and interactive games, we are creating a space where kids, families, and community members can move, play, and prioritize their well-being.
